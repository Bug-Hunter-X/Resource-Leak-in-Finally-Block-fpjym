This repository demonstrates a subtle Java bug related to resource management in a try-catch-finally block. The main program, UncommonBug.java, shows the incorrect handling of resources, while UncommonBugSolution.java provides a corrected version. Improper resource handling, even in simple examples, can lead to resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior in larger applications. Always ensure that resources are closed or released in the finally block to prevent these issues.
